# JWT-Auth-demonstration-with-nodeJS
A demonstration of using Json web tokens for authorization in nodeJS.

To run this locally, kindly proceed to clone or download.<br><br>
In the main repo directory, open the command line and rum npm install (you must have node installed) to download all required modules.<br><br>
After that, run node server.js or if you have nodemon installed, you could run nodemon server.js.<br><br>
Then you could test the running API with the frontend included in the /frontend folder or you could use REST API clients such as insomnia or postman to test the running API.<br><br>
The api would be running by default on port 3000 on localhost so the url would be http://localhost:3000/api_endpoint.<br><br>
The endpoints here are /login and /getstuff.<br><br><br><br>

Examine the code, run and experiment as you like!!!.<br>
